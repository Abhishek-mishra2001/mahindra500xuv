                  This vehicle runs on a battery and uses electricity instead of
                  gasoline like traditional cars. Please read this manual
                  carefully before using the vehicle because it operates
                  dierently
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  This vehicle is powered by electricity and has two batteries.
                  One battery, located under the chassis, gives power to drive
                  the vehicle hereafter referred as HV battery. The other
                  battery, a 12V car battery in the front compartment, powers
                  instruments, lights, and control modules hereafter referred as
                  LV battery
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>a. Charging the Traction Battery : </strong>The HV
                  battery in the car needs to be charged using household
                  electricity or approved DC - DC chargers. Make sure all wires,
                  sockets, and plugs can handle the power. Have a professional
                  electrician set up the charging system. It must be grounded
                  correctly and have a main switch and safety device.
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>b. High-voltage cable warning : </strong>The orange
                  cable in the car carries high voltage. Do not touch it. Pay
                  close attention to warning signs on parts with high voltage.

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>c. Entering ready mode : </strong>When you open the
                  door, the car switches to high-voltage mode. Step on the brake
                  pedal to start driving.
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>d. Using high-voltage mode : </strong>Once the car is
                  in high-voltage mode (doors open and car powered on), it
                  mainly uses the HV battery. It can run lights and air
                  conditioning for a long time. The HV battery also charges the
                  12V battery

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>e. Winter driving tips : </strong>In winter, the HV
                  battery's performance decreases when it's cold but improves as
                  it warms up. To take care of the battery, avoid fast starts
                  and driving fast for a long time in cold weather. Use the
                  heater smartly, plan your trip well, and charge the car on
                  time.

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>f. Safety during charging : </strong>It is forbidden
                  to use false grounding equipment such as the grounding and
                  resistance reduction module, which may cause potential safety
                  hazards of electric shock during charging.

                  Charge it promptly and avoid letting it completely run out
                  before charging again. This helps keep the battery working
                  well. It is recommended to fully charge the battery at least
                  once every two weeks when using the vehicle regularly for
                  maintenance.

                      50%. After prolonged parking, perform charging maintenance
                      at least once a month. This involves fully charging the

                      Be extra cautious of pedestrians. Since the vehicle is
                      quiet and doesn't make noise from the engine, pedestrians
                      might not realize it's approaching, moving, or getting
                      ready to move, and could accidentally step into its path.

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>a. Always use your seat belt : </strong>It provides
                  the best protection in any type of accident. Airbags are
                  designed to complement seat belts, not to replace them.
                  Therefore, even though your vehicle has airbags, ALWAYS ensure
                  that you and your passengers wear your seat belts and wear
                  them correctly.

                  <strong>b. Secure all children : </strong>All children under
                  the age of 13 should ride in the back seat of your vehicle,
                  properly restrained. Infants and small children should be
                  secured in an appropriate Child Restraint System. Older
                  children should use a booster seat with a lap/shoulder belt
                  until they can safely use the seat belt alone, without the
                  booster seat

                    lap portion of the seat belt during an accident or a sudden
                    stop. Serious or fatal internal injuries could result
                    because the seat belt cannot operate properly.

                  <strong>e. Avoid driver distraction : </strong>Driver
                  distraction is a significant and potentially fatal hazard,
                  particularly for inexperienced drivers. Always prioritize
                  safety and be aware of distractions like drowsiness, reaching
                  for objects, eating, grooming, interacting with other
                  passengers, and using mobile phones. To minimize distraction:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Set up mobile devices (e.g., phones, navigation units)
                      only when your vehicle is parked or stopped.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use mobile devices only when permitted by laws and when it
                      is safe. Never text or email while driving; many places
                      have laws against texting and some also ban handheld phone
                      use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Do not let mobile device use distract you from driving.
                      It's your responsibility to ensure that both hands remain
                      on the wheel and your attention stays on the road.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>f. Maintain appropriate speed: </strong>Driving at
                  excessive speeds is a leading cause of accidents and injuries.
                  Higher speeds increase the risk of severe consequences,
                  although serious injuries can also occur at lower speeds.
                  Always drive at a safe speed for the current conditions,
                  regardless of posted speed limits
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>g. Ensure vehicle safety : </strong>Tire blowouts or
                  mechanical failures can be dangerous. To minimize these risks,
                  regularly check your tire pressures and conditions, and follow
                  all scheduled maintenance guidelines.

                    <p>
                      When you sit on the seat, make your hip as close to the
                      backrest as possible. Adjust the distance between the seat
                      and the pedal to make your leg slightly bend when you
                      press the pedal. The passenger’s seat shall slide as
                      backward as possible
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Make your shoulders lean on the backrest as backward as
                      possible. Set the backrest inclination angle to make your
                      arm conveniently to reach the steering wheel while
                      slightly bending the arm. Keep the shoulders leaning
                      against the backrest while turning the steering wheel. The
                      backrest shall not incline excessively backward. We
                      suggest that the inclination angle of all backrests shall
                      not be more than 25 degrees.

                  The seat height shall be so set that the occupant can see all
                  directions and the positions of all display instruments. The
                  head must be at least one hand away from the roof lining. The
                  thighs are right on the seat without constriction.

                      <li>
                        NEVER adjust the seat while the vehicle is moving.
                        Unexpected movements could lead to losing control of the
                        vehicle and causing an accident.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Avoid placing anything under the front seats. Loose
                        objects in the driver's foot area might interfere with
                        the foot pedals and cause an accident.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ensure nothing interferes with the seatback's normal
                        position and proper locking.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Do not place a cigarette lighter on the floor or seat.
                        Operating the seat could cause gas to escape from the
                        lighter and start a fire.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Be careful when retrieving small objects trapped under
                        the seats or between the seat and the center console.
                        Sharp edges of the seat mechanism could cut or injure
                        your hands.

                        <strong>Reclining the seatback:</strong> Sitting in a
                        reclined position while the vehicle is moving can be
                        dangerous. Even if you're wearing your seat belt,
                        reclining the seatback reduces the eectiveness of your
                        seat belt and airbags.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Never recline the seatback while the vehicle is in
                        motion. Riding with a reclined seatback increases the
                        risk of serious or fatal injuries in a crash or sudden
                        stop. Drivers and passengers should always sit upright
                        in their seats, properly restrained, with the seatbacks
                        upright.

                      <p>
                        Seat belts need to fit tightly across your hips and
                        chest to work correctly. When the seatback is reclined,
                        the shoulder belt cannot properly secure your chest-it
                        may sit in front of you instead. In an accident, this
                        could cause you to be thrown into the seat belt,
                        potentially causing neck or other injuries.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The more the seatback is reclined, the higher the risk
                        that the passenger's hips could slide under the lap belt
                        or the passenger's neck could hit the shoulder belt.

                      it's not locked during a sudden stop or accident, things
                      in the back could move forward very fast and hurt people

                          The seat belt must be kept clean. Rough dirt will
                          hinder the function of the automatic retracting device
                          of the seat belt. It can be wiped with a wet cloth
                          without removal or replacement. Pay attention to
                          prevent foreign matters from getting in the seat belt

                          otherwise the seat belt buckle will fail.

                      The seat belt provides protection for everybody, including
                      a pregnant woman. Like all passengers, if pregnant women
                      do not wear the seat belt, severe personal injuries are
                      more likely to be caused to them. The pregnant woman shall
                      wear the hip/shoulder seat belt during the whole
                      pregnancy, and the hip belt shall be fastened as low as
                      possible. The best way to protect a fetus is to provide
                      safety protection to its mother. If the seat belt is
                      fastened correctly, the fetus is not vulnerable to injury
                      in case of a collision. For a pregnant woman or any
                      person, correct wearing is the key to exerting the best
                      protection eect of the seat belt.

                  can be selected. Child seat can only be placed on the 2nd row
                  seat, because the front seat is not equipped with an anchor
                  bracket. The statistical data of accidents show that placing

                          before putting a child in the seat. If the child is

                          vehicle due to the interior trim as well as the seat
                          shape and size. You have responsibility to ensure that

                          that the seat can be connected correctly to the
                          vehicle with its anchor system. If the child seat does

                  <p>Always wear seat belts and use Child Restraint Systems on every trip. Even with air bags, you can get seriously hurt or killed in a crash if you're not properly belted or wearing your seat belt when the air bag inflates. An inflating air bag could hit the child and cause serious or fatal injuries. ABC - Always Buckle Children under age 13 in the back seat. It's the safest place for kids of any age. If a child age 13 or older must sit in the front seat, make sure they're properly belted and move the seat as far back as it can go. All passengers should sit upright with their seat belt on, feet on the floor, until the vehicle is parked and turned o. If someone isn't in the right position during a crash, the air bag could hit them hard and cause serious injuries.</p>
                  <p>You and your passengers should avoid sitting too close to air bags or leaning against the door or centre console.  </p>

                  <p><strong>When shall the airbag be inflated? </strong>The frontal airbag is designed to be inflated in moderate to severe headon collision or almost head-on collision to reduce severe injury risks ofthe driver's and the front passenger's head and chest.</p>
                  <p>The frontal airbag is designed to be inflated in moderate to severe headon collision or almost head-on collision to reduce severe injury risks ofthe driver's and the front passenger's head and chest. Frontal airbag inflation is not primarily dependent on the speed of the vehicle, but on the object being collided with, the direction of the collision and the deceleration of the vehicle per unit time during the collision. The frontal airbag may be inflated at dierent collision speed. It depends on whether the vehicle hits the object straight or at an angle at the moment of the collision, and on whether the collided object is fixed or moving, non- deformable or deformable, narrow or wide. Due to dierent designs of each model, the collision inflation conditions of the frontal airbag may vary. Frontal airbags do not inflate in the event of a vehicle rollover, a rear collision and many side collisions. The frontal airbag may not inflate in slight headon or nearly head-on collisions, lateral or diagonal collisions, collisions to cylindrical objects (such as telegraph pole and tree trunk), rear-end collisions under large vehicle (trucks, etc.) breast board and lateral glancing collisions. As per the design, the seat lateralimpact airbag and the side curtain airbag will inflate according to the impact position in case of the moderate to severe lateral collisions. The seat lateral-impact airbag and the side curtain airbag may not inflate in slight side collisions and lateral-frontal or diagonal collisions. As per the design, the seat lateralimpact airbag and the side curtain airbag will inflate on the collision side of the vehicle. Airbags are not triggered in every collision. For a particular accident, it shall not simply judge whether the airbag should be inflated according to the causalities, vehicle damage or repair and maintenance expenses. Your vehicle is equipped with a collision sensing and diagnosis module. If a collision accident reaches certain strength, the module may record relevant collision information after the collision. If you have any questions about the airbag working condition of your vehicle in a collision accident, please contact the JSW MG authorised service center in time for professional analysis and diagnosis  </p>
                  <p><strong>How is the airbag inflated? </strong>During inflation, the sensing system sends an electronic signal that triggers the gas generator to release gas to fill the airbag, causing the airbag to inflate and eject from the cover. The gas generator, airbag and relevant members are all components of the airbag module. Please refer to "Airbag Position" for details.</p>
                  <p><strong>How does the airbag provide protection? </strong>The airbags supplement the protection provided by the seat belts by distributing the impact forces more evenly over the occupant's body. However, in collisions where the occupant's body is not moving in the direction of the airbag, and in collisions where an external object has entered the vehicle, the airbag is unable to provide the appropriate protection. The airbag shall only be seen as a supplementary device to the seat belt. </p>

                        When the airbag is inflated, dust may be spread in the air. All persons in the vehicle shall get o the vehicle as soon as possible. If you have a breathing problem and cannot get o the vehicle after airbag inflation, open the windows or doors to get fresh air. If breathing problems occur after the airbag is inflated, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible.

                  <p><strong>What will you see after the airbag inflates? </strong>When the airbag is inflated, it will deflate so quickly that some people may not even notice that the airbag has been inflated because it deflates so fast. Smoke and dust may also be emitted from the deflated airbag vent. If the vehicle power supply system can still work normally after a collision, the vehicle has the functions of automatically unlocking doors, turning on hazard warning lamps and turning o fuel system after airbag inflation. The driver can use corresponding function switch to lock doors, turn o indoors lamps and turn o the hazard warning lamp. The deployment of the front passenger air bag may also cause damage </p>
                  <ul><li>An airbag is designed to inflate only once. After the airbag is inflated, some parts of the airbag system need to be replaced. Otherwise, the airbag system will be unable to provide protection in the next collision accident. The airbag system parts that shall be replaced include the airbag module, airbag control module, seat belt pretensioner and other parts. </li>
                  <li>Work related to the SRS can only be done by JSW MG authorised Service Center technicians with corresponding qualification.

                  <p>EBD watches and manages how hard the brakes press on the back wheels to make driving safer when you brake. It adjusts the brake pressure so that the front and back wheels work together to stop the car quickly and keep it steady. This is done by reducing the pressure on the rear wheels when needed. </p>
                  <p>the EBD system uses the high-speed computer to respectively induce and calculate dierent ground to which four tires are attached, and thus calculate dierent friction values at the moment the vehicle brakes. Therefore, four tires can be able to brake in dierent ways and force based on dierent conditions, and can be adjusted fast during movement, so as to ensure that the vehicle is stable and safe.</p>

                  <p>The Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system is an advanced safety feature that builds on the functions of ABS and TCS. It includes sensors like the yaw rate sensor, lateral acceleration sensor, and steering wheel angle sensor. These sensors help monitor and control the driving and braking forces of all wheelsfront, rear, left, and right-through a computer (ECU). This ensures the vehicle stays stable during turns and manoeuvres. If the driver pushes the limits, especially during high-speed turns, the ESC system steps in automatically to regain control and keep the vehicle safe.</p>
                  <p>Indicators relevant to the ESC system consist of ABS MIL, EBD MIL, ESC MIL and ESC OFF indicator</p>
                  <ol><li> Indicators illuminate for selfinspect when the instrument is turned on. The 4 indicators are normally on for 3s, indicating that the ESC system is conducting self-inspect and indicators work normally. The 4 indicators go out 3s later under the normal condition. When faults (such as neglected installation, loosened connector, abnormal CAN communication) exist on the ESC system, only the ESC OFF lamp will go out 3s later, and the other 3 lamps are normally </li>
                  <li>In the process of driving, if the ESC function is activated, the ESC lamp will flicker, telling the user that the ESC system is working. If the ESC system functions are abnormal but the ABS+EBD system functions are normal, the ESC lamp is normally on, indicating that the ESC system gets faulted. If the ESC system and the ABS function are abnormal and the EBD system functions are normal, the ESC lamp and the ABS lamp are normally on. </li>
                  <li>The ESC OFF lamp is used to indicate that the ESC function is disabled (the lamp will be normally on so long as the ESC function is disabled; the lamp will go out if the function is enabled). If the user disables the ESC, some ESC functions will be disabled, and the ESC OFF lamp will illuminate. If ESC is working when it is to be disabled, the ESC function will not be disabled immediately and will be disabled after the work is over. If the user enables the ESC again, all functions will be restored.</li>
                  <li>Each time the vehicle is started, the ESC system will be activated automatically.</li></ol>
                  <!-- image here -->
                   <p>After you start the vehicle, the light on the indicator will turn on for a short time and then turn o. This shows that the indicator is working correctly. While you are driving, if the ESC turns on, its light will blink to let you know the system is active. But if the ESC light stays on without blinking, it means there is a problem with the system.</p>

                  <p><strong>Tips to get maximum range while driving EV </strong></p>
                  <ol><li>If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal instead of using the brake pedal when gradually slowing down. Whenever the vehicle is moving and you are not pressing the accelerator pedal, regenerative braking slows down the vehicle and feeds surplus energy back to the HV battery</li>
                  <li>. Limit the use of resources such as heating, and air conditioning. If you operate the air conditioner/heater for long duration, it will use too much electricity from HV battery.Turn OFF the heater and air conditioner if you do not need them</li>
                  <li>Using the climate control system to heat the cabin when the outside temperature is below 0°C uses more electricity and aects vehicle range more than when using the heater when the temperature is above 0°C</li>
                  <li>Press and hold the accelerator pedal to maintain speed and drive economically.</li>
                  <li>Gradually press and release the accelerator pedal when accelerating or decelerating</li>
                  <li>Do not use unnecessary electrical components while driving. </li>
                  <li>Do not load unnecessary items in the vehicle trunk. Any additional load in the car drains the battery. Do not add more accessories, do not keep dead weight in the car, and in general travel as light as possible.</li>
                  <li>Do not mount parts on the exterior of the car as it might increase drag</li>
                  <li>Service schedule should be adhered to.Fluid levels shouldbe maintained with in to lerance limits.Both of these also helps in realizing the maximum range potential of an electric vehicle</li>
                  <li>To optimize driving range use drive/ecomode and maintain the recommended tyre pressure</li>
                  <li>Drive in ECO mode</li>
                  <li>ECO mode helps reduce power consumption by reducing acceleration when compared to the same accelerator pedal position in the D (Drive) position.</li>
                  <li>Drive at a constant speed.Maintain cruising speeds with constant accelerator positions as much as possible</li>
                  <li>Accelerate slowly and smoothly.Gently press and release the accelerator pedal for acceleration and deceleration</li>
                  <li>Vehicle range may be substantially reduced in extremely cold conditions (for example, 0°C).</li>
                  <li>Release the accelerator pedal to slow down and do not apply the brakes when traic and road conditions allow.</li></ol>

If the vehicle is in a lowtemperature environment 0 (below -25 C) for a long time, the HV battery pack may freeze inside, resulting in failure to charge and to provide driving power to the vehicle, which is very dangerous.</li></ol></li>
                  <li>To increase the service life and safety of battery packs, it is recommended:
                    <ol><li>The vehicle without HV battery heating system cannot be charged when the internal temperature of the 0 HV battery is below 0 C. Therefore, at a low ambient temperature, please charge the vehicle as soon as possible within one hour after parking. If the vehicle cannot be charged due to the low temperature of the HV battery, move the vehicle to a warm place or drive for a period of time before charging.</li>
                    <li> When the vehicle will be stored for a long time (more than 1 month), charge the battery to about 60%, and disconnect the negative terminal of 12V battery in the compartment</li><li> Please try to avoid sharp acceleration or deceleration during driving</li></ol>
                  </li></ol>
                  <p>If the vehicle will be stored for a long time, charge the battery to about 60%, and disconnect the negative terminal of 12V battery. Long-term storage at very low SOC is not conducive to the service life of the HV battery.</p>

                  <div class="card-body"> The batteries are special chemical products that need proper use and maintenance. Routine full charge and full discharge are critical to the maintenance of their performance. In addition, the battery capacity is subject to natural attenuation due to the chemical properties. When you find a decrease in SOC range, it is recommended to check it at the JSW MG authorised service center. If the battery consistency is turned out to be within the normal range, this decrease is due to the normal attenuation of the battery capacity.
