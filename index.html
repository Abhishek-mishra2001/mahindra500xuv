                      This vehicle runs on a battery and uses electricity instead of
                      gasoline like traditional cars. Please read this manual
                      carefully before using the vehicle because it operates

                      This vehicle is powered by electricity and has two batteries.
                      One battery, located under the chassis, gives power to drive
                      the vehicle hereafter referred as HV battery. The other
                      battery, a 12V car battery in the front compartment, powers
                      instruments, lights, and control modules hereafter referred as
                      LV battery

                    <div class="x-p-8-0">
                      <strong>a. Charging the Traction Battery : </strong>The HV
                      battery in the car needs to be charged using household
                      electricity or approved DC - DC chargers. Make sure all wires,
                      sockets, and plugs can handle the power. Have a professional
                      electrician set up the charging system. It must be grounded
                      correctly and have a main switch and safety device.

                    <div class="x-p-8-0">
                      <strong>b. High-voltage cable warning : </strong>The orange
                      cable in the car carries high voltage. Do not touch it. Pay
                      close attention to warning signs on parts with high voltage.

                      door, the car switches to high-voltage mode. Step on the brake
                      pedal to start driving.

                      in high-voltage mode (doors open and car powered on), it
                      mainly uses the HV battery. It can run lights and air
                      conditioning for a long time. The HV battery also charges the
                      12V battery

                      battery's performance decreases when it's cold but improves as
                      it warms up. To take care of the battery, avoid fast starts
                      and driving fast for a long time in cold weather. Use the
                      heater smartly, plan your trip well, and charge the car on
                      time.

                      <strong>f. Safety during charging : </strong>It is forbidden
                      to use false grounding equipment such as the grounding and
                      resistance reduction module, which may cause potential safety
                      hazards of electric shock during charging.

                      <p><strong>a.	Battery	replacement	and recycling: </strong>If you need to replace the HV battery, handle it carefully to avoid injury. According to Indian laws & regulations, recycle the HV battery at an MG-designated recycling station. Disposing of these batteries improperly can harm the environment and people. Check the official website for recycling details.</p>
                      <p><strong>b.	Battery maintenance: </strong>When the instrument cluster's power bar turns red, it means the HV battery is low. Charge it promptly and avoid letting it completely run out before charging again. This helps  keep the battery working well. It is recommended to fully charge the battery at least once every two weeks when using the vehicle regularly for maintenance.</p>

                          <p>Before storing the vehicle for an extended period (over one month), ensure the battery is charged to more than 50%. After prolonged parking, perform charging maintenance at least once a month. This involves fully charging the vehicle using AC slow charging, then discharging it to between 40% and 60% before parking again. Failure to maintain the battery as recommended could lead to vehicle issues caused by over-discharge, which may not be covered under warranty.</p>

                  <p>This section of the manual, along with others, contains crucial safety guidelines. Please pay special attention to the following precautions:</p>
                  <p><strong>a.	Always use your seat belt: </strong>It provides the best protection in any type of accident. Airbags are designed to complement seat belts, not to replace them. Therefore, even though your vehicle has airbags, ALWAYS ensure that you and your passengers wear your seat belts and wear them correctly.</p>
                  <p><strong>b.	Secure all children: </strong>All children under the age of 13 should ride in the back seat of your vehicle, properly restrained. Infants and small children should be secured in an appropriate Child Restraint System. Older children should use a booster seat with a lap/shoulder belt until they can safely use the seat belt alone, without the booster seat.</p>

                  <p><strong>d.	Airbag risks: </strong>Though airbags can be life-saving, they can also cause serious or fatal injuries to those who are too close or not properly restrained. Infants, young children, and shorter adults are especially at risk. Adhere to all instructions and warnings provided in this manual regarding airbags.</p>

                  <p><strong>e.	Avoid driver distraction: </strong>Driver distraction is a signiﬁcant and potentially fatal hazard, particularly for inexperienced drivers. Always prioritize safety and be aware of distractions like drowsiness, reaching for objects, eating, grooming, interacting with other passengers, and using mobile phones. To minimize distraction:</p>
                  <ul><li>Set up mobile devices (e.g., phones, navigation units) only when your vehicle is parked or stopped.</li>
                  <li>•	Use mobile devices only when permitted by laws and when it is safe. Never text or email while driving; many places have laws against texting and some also ban handheld phone use.</li>
                  <li>•	Do not let mobile device use distract you from driving. It's your responsibility to ensure that both hands remain on the wheel and your attention stays on the road.</li></ul>

Always drive at a safe speed for the current conditions, regardless of posted speed limits.</p>
                  <p><strong>g.	Ensure vehicle safety: </strong>Tire blowouts or mechanical failures can be dangerous. To minimize these risks, regularly check your tire pressures and conditions, and follow all scheduled	maintenance guidelines.</p>

                        <p><strong>Reclining the seatback: </strong>Sitting in a reclined position while the vehicle is moving can be dangerous. Even if you're wearing your seat belt, reclining the seatback	reduces	the effectiveness of your seat belt and airbags.</p>
                        <p>Never recline the seatback while the vehicle is in motion. Riding with a reclined seatback increases the risk of serious or fatal injuries in a crash or sudden stop. Drivers and passengers should always sit upright in their seats, properly restrained, with the seatbacks upright.</p>
                        <p>Seat belts need to ﬁt tightly across your hips and chest to work correctly. When the seatback is reclined, the shoulder belt cannot properly secure your chest-it may sit in front of you instead. In an accident, this could cause you to be thrown into the seat belt, potentially causing neck or other injuries.</p>
                        <p>The more the seatback is reclined, the higher the risk that the passenger's hips could slide under the lap belt or the passenger's neck could hit the shoulder belt.</p>

                  <p>Always wear seat belts and use Child Restraint Systems on every trip. Even with air bags, you can get seriously hurt or killed in a crash if you're not properly belted or wearing your seat belt when the air bag inﬂates. An inﬂating air bag could hit the child and cause serious or fatal injuries. ABC - Always Buckle Children under age 13 in the back seat. It's the safest place for kids of any age. If a child age 13 or older must sit in the front seat, make sure they're properly belted and move the seat as far back as it can go. All passengers should sit upright with their seat belt on, feet on the ﬂoor, until the vehicle is parked and turned off. If someone isn't in the right position during a crash, the air bag could hit them hard and cause serious injuries.</p>
                  <p>You and your passengers should avoid sitting too close to air bags or leaning against the door or centre console.</p>

                  <p><strong>When shall the airbag be inﬂated? </strong>The frontal airbag is designed to be inﬂated in moderate to severe head- on collision or almost head-on collision to reduce severe injury risks ofthe driver's and the front passenger's head and chest.</p>
                  <p>Frontal airbag inﬂation is not primarily dependent on the speed of the vehicle, but on the object being collided with, the direction of the collision and the deceleration of the vehicle per unit time during the collision. The frontal airbag may be inﬂated at different collision speed. It depends on whether the vehicle hits the object straight or at an angle at the moment of the collision, and on whether the collided object is ﬁxed or moving, non- deformable or deformable, narrow or wide. Due to different designs of each model, the collision inﬂation conditions of the frontal airbag may vary. Frontal airbags do not inﬂate in the event of a vehicle rollover, a rear collision and many side collisions. The frontal airbag may not inﬂate in slight head- on or nearly head-on collisions, lateral or diagonal collisions, collisions to cylindrical objects (such as telegraph pole and tree trunk), rear-end collisions under</p>

                  <p>The seat lateral-impact airbag and the side curtain airbag may not inﬂate in slight side collisions and lateral-frontal or diagonal collisions. As per the design, the seat lateral- impact airbag and the side curtain airbag will inﬂate on the  collision side of the vehicle. Airbags are not triggered in every collision. For a particular accident, it shall not simply judge whether the airbag should be inﬂated according to the causalities, vehicle damage or repair and maintenance expenses. Your vehicle is equipped with a collision sensing and diagnosis module. If a collision accident reaches certain strength, the module may record relevant collision information after the collision. If you have any questions about the airbag working condition of your vehicle in a collision accident, please contact the JSW MG authorised service center in time for professional analysis and diagnosis.</p>

                  <p><strong>How is the airbag inﬂated? </strong>During inﬂation, the sensing system sends an electronic signal that triggers the gas generator to release gas to  ﬁll the airbag, causing the airbag to inﬂate and eject from the cover. The gas generator, airbag and relevant members are all components of the airbag module. Please refer to "Airbag Position" for details.</p>
                  <p><strong>How does the airbag provide protection?  </strong>The airbags supplement the protection provided by the seat belts by distributing the impact forces more evenly over the occupant's body. However, in collisions where the occupant's body is not moving in the direction of the airbag, and in  collisions  where an external object has entered the vehicle, the airbag is unable to provide the appropriate protection. The airbag shall only be seen as a supplementary device to the seat belt.</p>

                  <p><strong>What will you see after the airbag inﬂates? </strong>When the airbag is inﬂated, it will deﬂate so quickly that some people may not even notice that the airbag has been inﬂated because it deﬂates so fast. Smoke  and  dust may also be emitted from the deﬂated airbag vent. If the vehicle power supply system can still work normally after a collision, the vehicle has the functions of automatically unlocking doors, turning on hazard warning lamps and turning off fuel system after airbag inﬂation. The driver can use corresponding function switch to lock doors,  turn off indoors lamps and turn off the hazard warning lamp. The deployment of the front passenger air bag may also cause damage</p>

                  <p>EBD watches and manages how hard the brakes press on the back wheels to make driving safer when you brake. It adjusts the brake pressure so that the front and back wheels work together to stop the car quickly and keep it steady. This is done by reducing the pressure on the rear wheels when needed.</p>
                  <p>the EBD system uses the high-speed computer to respectively induce and calculate different ground to which four tires are attached, and thus calculate different friction values at the moment the vehicle brakes. Therefore, four tires can be able to brake in different ways and force based on different conditions, and can be adjusted fast during movement, so as to ensure that the vehicle is stable and safe.</p>

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <p>The Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system is an advanced safety feature that builds on the functions of ABS and TCS. It includes sensors like the yaw rate sensor, lateral acceleration sensor, and steering wheel angle sensor. These sensors help monitor and control the driving and braking forces of all wheels- front, rear, left, and right-through a computer (ECU). This ensures the vehicle stays stable during turns and manoeuvres. If the driver pushes the limits, especially during high-speed turns, the ESC system steps in automatically to regain control and keep the vehicle safe.</p>
                  <p>Indicators relevant to the ESC system consist of ABS MIL, EBD MIL, ESC MIL and ESC OFF indicator.</p>
                  <p>1)	Indicators illuminate for self- inspect when the instrument is turned on. The 4 indicators are normally on for 3s, indicating that the ESC system is conducting self-inspect and indicators work normally. The 4 indicators go out 3s later under the normal condition.</p>

                  <p>When faults (such as neglected installation, loosened connector, abnormal CAN   communication) exist on the ESC system,  only  the ESC OFF lamp will go out 3s  later, and the other 3 lamps are normally.</p>
                  <p>2)	In the process of driving, if  the ESC function is activated, the ESC lamp will ﬂicker, telling the user that the ESC system is working. If the ESC system functions are abnormal but the ABS+EBD system functions are normal, the ESC lamp is normally on, indicating that the ESC system gets faulted. If the ESC system and the ABS function are abnormal and the EBD system functions are normal, the ESC lamp and the ABS lamp are normally on.</p>
                  <p>3)	The ESC OFF lamp is used to indicate that the ESC function is disabled (the lamp will be normally on so long as the ESC function is disabled; the lamp will go out if the function is enabled).</p>

If ESC is working when it is to be disabled, the ESC function will not be disabled immediately and will be disabled after the work is over. If the user enables the ESC again, all functions will be restored.</p>

                  <p>After you start the vehicle, the light on the indicator will turn on for a short time and then turn off. This shows that the indicator is working correctly. While you are driving, if the ESC turns on, its light will blink to let you know the system is active. But if the ESC light stays on without blinking, it means there is a problem with the system.</p>

                        <p>The range is estimated for the reference of the driver and passengers only. The actual endurance mileage is related to various factors such as current road conditions (such as a long steep slope), driving habits (such as frequent acceleration and deceleration), temperature (such as low temperature), and whether electrical equipment (such  as A/C) is on.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tips to get maximum range while driving EV</strong></p>
                        <p>1.	If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal instead of using the brake pedal when gradually slowing down. Whenever the vehicle is moving and you are not pressing the accelerator pedal, regenerative braking slows down the vehicle and feeds surplus energy back to the HV battery.</p>
                        <p>2.	Limit the use of resources such as heating, and air conditioning. If you operate the air conditioner/heater for long duration, it will use too much electricity from HV battery.Turn OFF the heater and air conditioner if you do not need them.</p>
                        <p>3.	Using the climate control system to heat the cabin when the outside temperature is below 0°C uses more electricity and affects vehicle range more than when using the heater when the temperature is above 0°C.</p>
                        <p>4.	Press and hold the accelerator pedal to maintain speed and drive economically.</p>
                        <p>5.	Gradually press and release the accelerator pedal when accelerating or decelerating.</p>
                        <p>6.	Do not use unnecessary electrical components while driving.</p>
                        <p>7.	Do not load unnecessary  items in the vehicle trunk. Any additional load in the car drains the battery. Do not add more accessories, do not keep dead weight in the car, and in general travel as light as possible.</p>
                        <p>8.	Do not mount parts on the exterior of the car as it might increase drag.</p>

                  <p>9. Service schedule should be adhered to. Fluid levels should be maintained within tolerance limits. Both of these also helps in realizing the maximum range potential of an electric vehicle</p>
                  <p>10.	To optimize driving range use drive/eco mode and  maintain the recommended tyre pressure.</p>
                  <p>11.	Drive in ECO mode</p>
                  <p>12. ECO mode helps reduce power consumption by reducing acceleration when compared to the same accelerator pedal position in the D (Drive) position.</p>
                  <p>13.	Drive at a constant speed. Maintain cruising speeds with constant accelerator positions as much as possible.</p>
                  <p>14.	Accelerate slowly and smoothly. Gently press and release the accelerator	pedal	for acceleration and deceleration.</p>
                  <p>15.	Vehicle range may be substantially reduced in extremely cold conditions (for example, 0°C).</p>
                  <p>16.	Release the accelerator pedal to slow down and do not apply the brakes when traffic and road conditions allow.</p>

Routine full charge and full discharge are critical to the maintenance	of	their performance. In addition, the battery capacity is subject to natural attenuation due to the chemical properties. When you ﬁnd a decrease in SOC range, it is recommended to check it at the JSW MG authorised service center.

                  <p><strong>f.	Driving on gradients: </strong>When going downhill, ease off the accelerator to reduce speed. Avoid shifting to neutral or turning off the vehicle. EVs (Electric Vehicle) typically achieve their best range between speeds of 40 to 60 km/h, making them ideal for city driving. Staying within this speed range, along with following other driving tips, can signiﬁcantly increase your mileage. On highways, it's recommended to maintain a speed between 60 to 80 km/h to optimize range. Higher speeds can lead to a noticeable decrease in range.</p>

                  <p><strong>g.	Driving on Highways: </strong>Avoid rapid changes in accelerator pedal inputs. Drive as smoothly as possible. EVs respond instantly to pedal inputs due to their immediate torque and power. The stopping distance increases progressively with vehicle speed, so maintain a safe distance from the vehicle.</p>
                  <p><strong>For long-distance driving: </strong>Perform safety checks before starting your trip and take breaks at regular intervals to prevent fatigue.</p>
                  <p><strong>h.	Driving in hot and cold weather: </strong>The vehicle's heating and cooling systems use energy from the battery. Set the temperature to a comfortable range of 24°C to 26°C with Auto mode and Econ activated to maximize both comfort and range.</p>

Then, the outside rearview mirror will be unfolded smoothly. If the freeze is not removed, it will hinder the movement of the rearview mirror, damaging the mirror. If the outside rearview mirror glass is frozen, please remove the freeze ﬁrst, and then use the defrosting function for auxiliary heating and deicing. If the freeze is not removed, the freeze will hinder the movement of the mirror while adjusting the mirror, causing damage to the mirror.</p>

Note: The size of each brand of mobile phone is different, and the position of the charging coil on the mobile phone is different. Please adjust the position of the mobile phone accordingly. In addition, the case of some mobile phones may have an impact on wireless charging. It may be necessary to adjust or remove the case to achieve wireless charging.</p>
                        <p>2. If the mobile phone cannot be charged correctly, please make sure that there is no foreign matter in the wireless charging area or wait for the wireless charging area to cool down before further attempts. If it still fails, seek the JSW MG Authorised service center.</p>
                        <p>Eg. Latest iPhone models have inbuilt Mag safe technology which limits the wireless charging performance.</p>

                <strong>a. Battery replacement and recycling: </strong>If you
                need to replace the HV battery, handle it carefully to avoid
                injury. According to Indian laws & regulations, recycle the HV
                battery at an MG-designated recycling station. Disposing of
                these batteries improperly can harm the environment and

                <strong>b. Battery maintenance: </strong>When the instrument
                cluster's power bar turns red, it means the HV battery is low.
                Charge it promptly and avoid letting it completely run out
                before charging again. This helps keep the battery working
                well. It is recommended to fully charge the battery at least
                once every two weeks when using the vehicle regularly for
                maintenance.

                    Before storing the vehicle for an extended period (over
                    one month), ensure the battery is charged to more than
                    50%. After prolonged parking, perform charging maintenance
                    at least once a month. This involves fully charging the
                    vehicle using AC slow charging, then discharging it to
                    between 40% and 60% before parking again. Failure to

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>a. Always use your seat belt : </strong>It provides
                  the best protection in any type of accident. Airbags are
                  designed to complement seat belts, not to replace them.
                  Therefore, even though your vehicle has airbags, ALWAYS ensure
                  that you and your passengers wear your seat belts and wear
                  them correctly.

                  the age of 13 should ride in the back seat of your vehicle,
                  properly restrained. Infants and small children should be
                  secured in an appropriate Child Restraint System. Older
                  children should use a booster seat with a lap/shoulder belt
                  until they can safely use the seat belt alone, without the

                  <strong>e. Avoid driver distraction : </strong>Driver
                  distraction is a significant and potentially fatal hazard,
                  particularly for inexperienced drivers. Always prioritize
                  safety and be aware of distractions like drowsiness, reaching
                  for objects, eating, grooming, interacting with other
                  passengers, and using mobile phones. To minimize distraction:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Set up mobile devices (e.g., phones, navigation units)
                      only when your vehicle is parked or stopped.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use mobile devices only when permitted by laws and when it
                      is safe. Never text or email while driving; many places
                      have laws against texting and some also ban handheld phone
                      use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Do not let mobile device use distract you from driving.
                      It's your responsibility to ensure that both hands remain
                      on the wheel and your attention stays on the road.

                  <strong>f. Maintain appropriate speed: </strong>Driving at
                  excessive speeds is a leading cause of accidents and injuries.
                  Higher speeds increase the risk of severe consequences,
                  although serious injuries can also occur at lower speeds.
                  Always drive at a safe speed for the current conditions,
                  regardless of posted speed limits

                  regularly check your tire pressures and conditions, and follow
                  all scheduled maintenance guidelines.

                      When you sit on the seat, make your hip as close to the
                      backrest as possible. Adjust the distance between the seat

                    <p>
                      Make your shoulders lean on the backrest as backward as
                      possible. Set the backrest inclination angle to make your
                      arm conveniently to reach the steering wheel while
                      slightly bending the arm. Keep the shoulders leaning
                      against the backrest while turning the steering wheel. The
                      backrest shall not incline excessively backward. We
                      suggest that the inclination angle of all backrests shall
                      not be more than 25 degrees.

                    When adjusting your seat, follow these precautions:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        NEVER adjust the seat while the vehicle is moving.
                        Unexpected movements could lead to losing control of the
                        vehicle and causing an accident.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Avoid placing anything under the front seats. Loose
                        objects in the driver's foot area might interfere with
                        the foot pedals and cause an accident.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ensure nothing interferes with the seatback's normal
                        position and proper locking.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Do not place a cigarette lighter on the floor or seat.
                        Operating the seat could cause gas to escape from the
                        lighter and start a fire.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Be careful when retrieving small objects trapped under
                        the seats or between the seat and the center console.
                        Sharp edges of the seat mechanism could cut or injure
                        your hands.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If there are rear seat passengers, adjust the front seat
                        position carefully.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        After adjusting the seat, always ensure it is securely
                        locked in place. If it's not locked properly, the seat
                        could unexpectedly move and cause an accident.

                        Avoid adjusting the seats for longer than needed when
                        the vehicle is turned o to prevent unnecessary battery
                        drain.

                        reclined position while the vehicle is moving can be
                        dangerous. Even if you're wearing your seat belt,
                        reclining the seatback reduces the eectiveness of your
                        seat belt and airbags.

                      <p>
                        Never recline the seatback while the vehicle is in
                        motion. Riding with a reclined seatback increases the
                        risk of serious or fatal injuries in a crash or sudden
                        stop. Drivers and passengers should always sit upright
                        in their seats, properly restrained, with the seatbacks
                        upright.

                      <p>
                        Seat belts need to fit tightly across your hips and
                        chest to work correctly. When the seatback is reclined,
                        the shoulder belt cannot properly secure your chest-it
                        may sit in front of you instead. In an accident, this
                        could cause you to be thrown into the seat belt,
                        potentially causing neck or other injuries.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The more the seatback is reclined, the higher the risk
                        that the passenger's hips could slide under the lap belt
                        or the passenger's neck could hit the shoulder belt.

                      When you're putting the rear seatback back up from being
                      folded, hold it and move it slowly. Make sure it locks

                      it's not locked during a sudden stop or accident, things
                      in the back could move forward very fast and hurt people
                      inside the car.

                      When folding the seatback, gently press against it or the
                      headrest to control how fast it folds. If you don't press,
                      it might fold down suddenly and hurt someone when you pull
                      the lever.

                      The seat belt provides protection for everybody, including
                      a pregnant woman. Like all passengers, if pregnant women
                      do not wear the seat belt, severe personal injuries are
                      more likely to be caused to them. The pregnant woman shall
                      wear the hip/shoulder seat belt during the whole
                      pregnancy, and the hip belt shall be fastened as low as
                      possible. The best way to protect a fetus is to provide
                      safety protection to its mother. If the seat belt is
                      fastened correctly, the fetus is not vulnerable to injury
                      in case of a collision. For a pregnant woman or any
                      person, correct wearing is the key to exerting the best
                      protection eect of the seat belt.

                  <p>Always wear seat belts and use Child Restraint Systems on every trip. Even with air bags, you can get seriously hurt or killed in a crash if you're not properly belted or wearing your seat belt when the air bag inflates. An inflating air bag could hit the child and cause serious or fatal injuries. ABC - Always Buckle Children under age 13 in the back seat. It's the safest place for kids of any age. If a child age 13 or older must sit in the front seat, make sure they're properly belted and move the seat as far back as it can go. All passengers should sit upright with their seat belt on, feet on the floor, until the vehicle is parked and turned o. If someone isn't in the right position during a crash, the air bag could hit them hard and cause serious injuries.</p>
                  <p>You and your passengers should avoid sitting too close to air bags or leaning against the door or centre console.  </p>
                  <p>Move your seat back as far as possible from front air bags while still being able to control the vehicle. </p>

                  <p><strong>When shall the airbag be inflated? </strong>The frontal airbag is designed to be inflated in moderate to severe headon collision or almost head-on collision to reduce severe injury risks ofthe driver's and the front passenger's head and chest.</p>
                  <p>The frontal airbag is designed to be inflated in moderate to severe headon collision or almost head-on collision to reduce severe injury risks ofthe driver's and the front passenger's head and chest. Frontal airbag inflation is not primarily dependent on the speed of the vehicle, but on the object being collided with, the direction of the collision and the deceleration of the vehicle per unit time during the collision. The frontal airbag may be inflated at dierent collision speed. It depends on whether the vehicle hits the object straight or at an angle at the moment of the collision, and on whether the collided object is fixed or moving, non- deformable or deformable, narrow or wide. Due to dierent designs of each model, the collision inflation conditions of the frontal airbag may vary. Frontal airbags do not inflate in the event of a vehicle rollover, a rear collision and many side collisions. The frontal airbag may not inflate in slight headon or nearly head-on collisions, lateral or diagonal collisions, collisions to cylindrical objects (such as telegraph pole and tree trunk), rear-end collisions under large vehicle (trucks, etc.) breast board and lateral glancing collisions. As per the design, the seat lateralimpact airbag and the side curtain airbag will inflate according to the impact position in case of the moderate to severe lateral collisions. The seat lateral-impact airbag and the side curtain airbag may not inflate in slight side collisions and lateral-frontal or diagonal collisions. As per the design, the seat lateralimpact airbag and the side curtain airbag will inflate on the collision side of the vehicle. Airbags are not triggered in every collision. For a particular accident, it shall not simply judge whether the airbag should be inflated according to the causalities, vehicle damage or repair and maintenance expenses. Your vehicle is equipped with a collision sensing and diagnosis module. If a collision accident reaches certain strength, the module may record relevant collision information after the collision. If you have any questions about the airbag working condition of your vehicle in a collision accident, please contact the JSW MG authorised service center in time for professional analysis and diagnosis  </p>
                  <p><strong>How is the airbag inflated? </strong>During inflation, the sensing system sends an electronic signal that triggers the gas generator to release gas to fill the airbag, causing the airbag to inflate and eject from the cover. The gas generator, airbag and relevant members are all components of the airbag module. Please refer to "Airbag Position" for details.</p>
                  <p><strong>How does the airbag provide protection? </strong>The airbags supplement the protection provided by the seat belts by distributing the impact forces more evenly over the occupant's body. However, in collisions where the occupant's body is not moving in the direction of the airbag, and in collisions where an external object has entered the vehicle, the airbag is unable to provide the appropriate protection. The airbag shall only be seen as a supplementary device to the seat belt. </p>

                  <p><strong>What will you see after the airbag inflates? </strong>When the airbag is inflated, it will deflate so quickly that some people may not even notice that the airbag has been inflated because it deflates so fast. Smoke and dust may also be emitted from the deflated airbag vent. If the vehicle power supply system can still work normally after a collision, the vehicle has the functions of automatically unlocking doors, turning on hazard warning lamps and turning o fuel system after airbag inflation. The driver can use corresponding function switch to lock doors, turn o indoors lamps and turn o the hazard warning lamp. The deployment of the front passenger air bag may also cause damage </p>
                  <ul><li>An airbag is designed to inflate only once. After the airbag is inflated, some parts of the airbag system need to be replaced. Otherwise, the airbag system will be unable to provide protection in the next collision accident. The airbag system parts that shall be replaced include the airbag module, airbag control module, seat belt pretensioner and other parts. </li>
                  <li>Work related to the SRS can only be done by JSW MG authorised Service Center technicians with corresponding qualification.

                  <p>The Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system is an advanced safety feature that builds on the functions of ABS and TCS. It includes sensors like the yaw rate sensor, lateral acceleration sensor, and steering wheel angle sensor. These sensors help monitor and control the driving and braking forces of all wheelsfront, rear, left, and right-through a computer (ECU). This ensures the vehicle stays stable during turns and manoeuvres. If the driver pushes the limits, especially during high-speed turns, the ESC system steps in automatically to regain control and keep the vehicle safe.</p>
                  <p>Indicators relevant to the ESC system consist of ABS MIL, EBD MIL, ESC MIL and ESC OFF indicator</p>
                  <ol><li> Indicators illuminate for selfinspect when the instrument is turned on. The 4 indicators are normally on for 3s, indicating that the ESC system is conducting self-inspect and indicators work normally. The 4 indicators go out 3s later under the normal condition. When faults (such as neglected installation, loosened connector, abnormal CAN communication) exist on the ESC system, only the ESC OFF lamp will go out 3s later, and the other 3 lamps are normally </li>
                  <li>In the process of driving, if the ESC function is activated, the ESC lamp will flicker, telling the user that the ESC system is working. If the ESC system functions are abnormal but the ABS+EBD system functions are normal, the ESC lamp is normally on, indicating that the ESC system gets faulted. If the ESC system and the ABS function are abnormal and the EBD system functions are normal, the ESC lamp and the ABS lamp are normally on. </li>
                  <li>The ESC OFF lamp is used to indicate that the ESC function is disabled (the lamp will be normally on so long as the ESC function is disabled; the lamp will go out if the function is enabled). If the user disables the ESC, some ESC functions will be disabled, and the ESC OFF lamp will illuminate. If ESC is working when it is to be disabled, the ESC function will not be disabled immediately and will be disabled after the work is over. If the user enables the ESC again, all functions will be restored.</li>
                  <li>Each time the vehicle is started, the ESC system will be activated automatically.</li></ol>

                   <p>After you start the vehicle, the light on the indicator will turn on for a short time and then turn o. This shows that the indicator is working correctly. While you are driving, if the ESC turns on, its light will blink to let you know the system is active. But if the ESC light stays on without blinking, it means there is a problem with the system.</p>

                  <p><strong>Tips to get maximum range while driving EV </strong></p>
                  <ol><li>If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal instead of using the brake pedal when gradually slowing down. Whenever the vehicle is moving and you are not pressing the accelerator pedal, regenerative braking slows down the vehicle and feeds surplus energy back to the HV battery</li>
                  <li>. Limit the use of resources such as heating, and air conditioning. If you operate the air conditioner/heater for long duration, it will use too much electricity from HV battery.Turn OFF the heater and air conditioner if you do not need them</li>
                  <li>Using the climate control system to heat the cabin when the outside temperature is below 0°C uses more electricity and aects vehicle range more than when using the heater when the temperature is above 0°C</li>
                  <li>Press and hold the accelerator pedal to maintain speed and drive economically.</li>
                  <li>Gradually press and release the accelerator pedal when accelerating or decelerating</li>
                  <li>Do not use unnecessary electrical components while driving. </li>
                  <li>Do not load unnecessary items in the vehicle trunk. Any additional load in the car drains the battery. Do not add more accessories, do not keep dead weight in the car, and in general travel as light as possible.</li>
                  <li>Do not mount parts on the exterior of the car as it might increase drag</li>
                  <li>Service schedule should be adhered to.Fluid levels shouldbe maintained with in to lerance limits.Both of these also helps in realizing the maximum range potential of an electric vehicle</li>
                  <li>To optimize driving range use drive/ecomode and maintain the recommended tyre pressure</li>
                  <li>Drive in ECO mode</li>
                  <li>ECO mode helps reduce power consumption by reducing acceleration when compared to the same accelerator pedal position in the D (Drive) position.</li>
                  <li>Drive at a constant speed.Maintain cruising speeds with constant accelerator positions as much as possible</li>
                  <li>Accelerate slowly and smoothly.Gently press and release the accelerator pedal for acceleration and deceleration</li>
                  <li>Vehicle range may be substantially reduced in extremely cold conditions (for example, 0°C).</li>
                  <li>Release the accelerator pedal to slow down and do not apply the brakes when traic and road conditions allow.</li></ol>

              <ol><li> If conditions permit, it is recommended that you charge the vehicle when parking it. Shallow charge and discharge is conducive to prolonging the battery life.

Routine full charge and full discharge are critical to the maintenance of their performance. In addition, the battery capacity is subject to natural attenuation due to the chemical properties. When you find a decrease in SOC range, it is recommended to check it at the JSW MG authorised service center. If the battery consistency is turned out to be within the normal range, this decrease is due to the normal attenuation of the battery capacity.
