                  This vehicle runs on a battery and uses electricity instead of
                  gasoline like traditional cars. Please read this manual
                  carefully before using the vehicle because it operates
                  dierently
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  This vehicle is powered by electricity and has two batteries.
                  One battery, located under the chassis, gives power to drive
                  the vehicle hereafter referred as HV battery. The other
                  battery, a 12V car battery in the front compartment, powers
                  instruments, lights, and control modules hereafter referred as
                  LV battery
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>a. Charging the Traction Battery : </strong>The HV
                  battery in the car needs to be charged using household
                  electricity or approved DC - DC chargers. Make sure all wires,
                  sockets, and plugs can handle the power. Have a professional
                  electrician set up the charging system. It must be grounded
                  correctly and have a main switch and safety device.
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>b. High-voltage cable warning : </strong>The orange
                  cable in the car carries high voltage. Do not touch it. Pay
                  close attention to warning signs on parts with high voltage.
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>c. Entering ready mode : </strong>When you open the
                  door, the car switches to high-voltage mode. Step on the brake
                  pedal to start driving.
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>d. Using high-voltage mode : </strong>Once the car is
                  in high-voltage mode (doors open and car powered on), it
                  mainly uses the HV battery. It can run lights and air
                  conditioning for a long time. The HV battery also charges the
                  12V battery
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>e. Winter driving tips : </strong>In winter, the HV
                  battery's performance decreases when it's cold but improves as
                  it warms up. To take care of the battery, avoid fast starts
                  and driving fast for a long time in cold weather. Use the
                  heater smartly, plan your trip well, and charge the car on
                  time.
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>f. Safety during charging : </strong>It is forbidden
                  to use false grounding equipment such as the grounding and
                  resistance reduction module, which may cause potential safety
                  hazards of electric shock during charging.

                  need to replace the HV battery, handle it carefully to avoid
                  injury. According to Indian laws & regulations, recycle the HV

                  Charge it promptly and avoid letting it completely run out
                  before charging again. This helps keep the battery working
                  well. It is recommended to fully charge the battery at least
                  once every two weeks when using the vehicle regularly for
                  maintenance.

                      50%. After prolonged parking, perform charging maintenance
                      at least once a month. This involves fully charging the
                      vehicle using AC slow charging, then discharging it to
                      between 40% and 60% before parking again. Failure to

Airbags are designed to complement seat belts, not to replace them. Therefore, even though your vehicle has airbags, ALWAYS ensure that you and your passengers wear your seat belts and wear them correctly.</div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0"><strong>b. Secure all children : </strong>All children under the age of 13 should ride in the back seat of your vehicle, properly restrained. Infants and small children should be secured in an appropriate Child Restraint System. Older children should use a booster seat with a lap/shoulder belt until they can safely use the seat belt alone, without the booster seat</div>

Always prioritize safety and be aware of distractions like drowsiness, reaching for objects, eating, grooming, interacting with other passengers, and using mobile phones. To minimize distraction:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Set up mobile devices (e.g., phones, navigation units) only when your vehicle is parked or stopped.</li>
                    <li>Use mobile devices only when permitted by laws and when it is safe. Never text or email while driving; many places have laws against texting and some also ban handheld phone use.</li>
