                  This vehicle runs on a battery and uses electricity instead of
                  gasoline like traditional cars. Please read this manual
                  carefully before using the vehicle because it operates
                  dierently

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  This vehicle is powered by electricity and has two batteries.
                  One battery, located under the chassis, gives power to drive
                  the vehicle hereafter referred as HV battery. The other
                  battery, a 12V car battery in the front compartment, powers
                  instruments, lights, and control modules hereafter referred as
                  LV battery
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>a. Charging the Traction Battery : </strong>The HV
                  battery in the car needs to be charged using household
                  electricity or approved DC - DC chargers. Make sure all wires,
                  sockets, and plugs can handle the power. Have a professional
                  electrician set up the charging system. It must be grounded
                  correctly and have a main switch and safety device.
                </div>
                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>b. High-voltage cable warning : </strong>The orange
                  cable in the car carries high voltage. Do not touch it. Pay
                  close attention to warning signs on parts with high voltage.

                  <strong>c. Entering ready mode : </strong>When you open the
                  door, the car switches to high-voltage mode. Step on the brake
                  pedal to start driving.

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>d. Using high-voltage mode : </strong>Once the car is
                  in high-voltage mode (doors open and car powered on), it
                  mainly uses the HV battery. It can run lights and air
                  conditioning for a long time. The HV battery also charges the
                  12V battery

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>e. Winter driving tips : </strong>In winter, the HV
                  battery's performance decreases when it's cold but improves as
                  it warms up. To take care of the battery, avoid fast starts
                  and driving fast for a long time in cold weather. Use the
                  heater smartly, plan your trip well, and charge the car on
                  time.

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <strong>f. Safety during charging : </strong>It is forbidden
                  to use false grounding equipment such as the grounding and
                  resistance reduction module, which may cause potential safety
                  hazards of electric shock during charging.

                    charging again. This helps keep the battery working well. It is recommended to fully charge the
                    battery at least once every two weeks when using the vehicle regularly for maintenance.</p>

                <p>This section of the manual, along with others, contains crucial safety guidelines. Please pay special
                  attention to the following precautions:</p>
                <p><strong>a. Always use your seat belt: </strong>It provides the best protection in any type of
                  accident. Airbags are designed to complement seat belts, not to replace them. Therefore, even though
                  your vehicle has airbags, ALWAYS ensure that you and your passengers wear your seat belts and wear
                  them correctly.</p>
                <p><strong>b. Secure all children: </strong>All children under the age of 13 should ride in the back
                  seat of your vehicle, properly restrained. Infants and small children should be secured in an
                  appropriate Child Restraint System. Older children should use a booster seat with a lap/shoulder belt
                  until they can safely use the seat belt alone, without the booster seat.</p>

                        important role for the safety of the driver and passengers, as much as seat belts and air bags

                      <p>Do not use a cushion that reduces friction between the seat and the passenger. The passenger's
                        hips may slide under the lap portion of the seat belt during an accident or a sudden stop.
                        Serious or fatal internal injuries could result because the seat belt cannot operate properly.

                <p><strong>c. Safety precautions: </strong>Adjusting the seats so that you are sitting in a safe and
                  comfortable position plays an important role for the safety of the driver and passengers, as much as
                  seat belts and air bags when in an accident.</p>
                <p><strong>d. Airbag risks: </strong>Though airbags can be life-saving, they can also cause serious or
                  fatal injuries to those who are too close or not properly restrained. Infants, young children, and
                  shorter adults are especially at risk. Adhere to all instructions and warnings provided in this manual
                  regarding airbags.</p>

                <p><strong>e. Avoid driver distraction: </strong>Driver distraction is a signiﬁcant and potentially
                  fatal hazard, particularly for inexperienced drivers. Always prioritize safety and be aware of
                  distractions like drowsiness, reaching for objects, eating, grooming, interacting with other
                  passengers, and using mobile phones. To minimize distraction:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Set up mobile devices (e.g., phones, navigation units) only when your vehicle is parked or
                    stopped.</li>
                  <li>• Use mobile devices only when permitted by laws and when it is safe. Never text or email while
                    driving; many places have laws against texting and some also ban handheld phone use.</li>
                  <li>• Do not let mobile device use distract you from driving. It's your responsibility to ensure that
                    both hands remain on the wheel and your attention stays on the road.</li>
                </ul>

              <div class="x-p-8-0">
                <p><strong>f. Maintain appropriate speed: </strong>Driving at excessive speeds is a leading cause of
                  accidents and injuries. Higher speeds increase the risk of severe consequences, although serious
                  injuries can also occur at lower speeds. Always drive at a safe speed for the current conditions,
                  regardless of posted speed limits.</p>
                <p><strong>g. Ensure vehicle safety: </strong>Tire blowouts or mechanical failures can be dangerous. To
                  minimize these risks, regularly check your tire pressures and conditions, and follow all scheduled
                  maintenance guidelines.</p>

                          <li>Avoid placing anything under the front seats. Loose objects in the driver's foot area
                            might interfere with the foot pedals and cause an accident.</li>
                          <li>Ensure nothing interferes with the seatback's normal position and proper locking.</li>
                          <li>Do not place a cigarette lighter on the ﬂoor or seat. Operating the seat could cause gas
                            to escape from the lighter and start a ﬁre.</li>

                          <li>Avoid adjusting the seats for longer than needed when the vehicle is turned off to prevent

                        <p><strong>Reclining the seatback: </strong>Sitting in a reclined position while the vehicle is
                          moving can be dangerous. Even if you're wearing your seat belt, reclining the seatback reduces
                          the eectiveness of your seat belt and airbags.</p>
                        <p>Never recline the seatback while the vehicle is in motion. Riding with a reclined seatback
                          increases the risk of serious or fatal injuries in a crash or sudden stop. Drivers and
                          passengers should always sit upright in their seats, properly restrained, with the seatbacks
                          upright.</p>
                        <p>Seat belts need to fit tightly across your hips and chest to work correctly. When the
                          seatback is reclined, the shoulder belt cannot properly secure your chest-it may sit in front
                          of you instead. In an accident, this could cause you to be thrown into the seat belt,
                          potentially causing neck or other injuries.</p>
                        <p>The more the seatback is reclined, the higher the risk that the passenger's hips could slide
                          under the lap belt or the passenger's neck could hit the shoulder belt.</p>

                    belt shall be fastened as low as possible.The best way to protect a fetus is to provide safety
                    protection to its mother. If the seat belt is fastened correctly,the fetus is not vulnerable to
                    injury in case of a collision. For a
                    pregnant woman or any person, correct wearing is the key to exerting the best protection effect of
                    the seat belt.</p>

                    ISOFIX "general" type can be selected. Child seat can only be placed on the 2nd row seat, because
                    the front seat is not equipped with an anchor bracket. The statistical data of accidents show that
                    placing the child seat on the second row seat can largely improve the child safety.</p>

                          in the seat. If the child is too small and the seat belt cannot provide the best protection
                          for him/her, please make sure that a proper child seat is used to provide safety protection.

                          applicable to your vehicle due to the interior trim as well as the seat shape and size. You
                          have responsibility to ensure that the child seat installed matches with your vehicle and that
                          the seat can be connected correctly to the vehicle with its anchor system. If the child seat
                          does not match with your vehicle size and the child body ﬁgure or the connection to your
                          vehicle is incorrect, severe personal injuries will be caused to the child and other

                  <p>Always wear seat belts and use Child Restraint Systems on every trip. Even with air bags, you can
                    get seriously hurt or killed in a crash if you're not properly belted or wearing your seat belt when
                    the air bag inﬂates. An inﬂating air bag could hit the child and cause serious or fatal injuries.
                    ABC - Always Buckle Children under age 13 in the back seat. It's the safest place for kids of any
                    age. If a child age 13 or older must sit in the front seat, make sure they're properly belted and
                    move the seat as far back as it can go. All passengers should sit upright with their seat belt on,
                    feet on the ﬂoor, until the vehicle is parked and turned off. If someone isn't in the right position
                    during a crash, the air bag could hit them hard and cause serious injuries.</p>
                  <p>You and your passengers should avoid sitting too close to air bags or leaning against the door or
                    centre console.</p>
                  <p>Move your seat back as far as possible from front air bags while still being able to control the
                    vehicle.</p>

                  <p><strong>When shall the airbag be inﬂated? </strong>The frontal airbag is designed to be inﬂated in
                    moderate to severe head- on collision or almost head-on collision to reduce severe injury risks
                    ofthe driver's and the front passenger's head and chest.</p>
                  <p>Frontal airbag inﬂation is not primarily dependent on the speed of the vehicle, but on the object
                    being collided with, the direction of the collision and the deceleration of the vehicle per unit
                    time during the collision. The frontal airbag may be inﬂated at different collision speed. It
                    depends on whether the vehicle hits the object straight or at an angle at the moment of the
                    collision, and on whether the collided object is ﬁxed or moving, non- deformable or deformable,
                    narrow or wide. Due to different designs of each model, the collision inﬂation conditions of the
                    frontal airbag may vary. Frontal airbags do not inﬂate in the event of a vehicle rollover, a rear
                    collision and many side collisions. The frontal airbag may not inﬂate in slight head- on or nearly
                    head-on collisions, lateral or diagonal collisions, collisions to cylindrical objects (such as
                    telegraph pole and tree trunk), rear-end collisions under</p>

                    seat lateral- impact airbag and the side curtain airbag will inﬂate according to the impact position
                    in case of the moderate to severe lateral collisions.</p>
                  <p>The seat lateral-impact airbag and the side curtain airbag may not inﬂate in slight side collisions
                    and lateral-frontal or diagonal collisions. As per the design, the seat lateral- impact airbag and
                    the side curtain airbag will inﬂate on the collision side of the vehicle. Airbags are not triggered
                    in every collision. For a particular accident, it shall not simply judge whether the airbag should
                    be inﬂated according to the causalities, vehicle damage or repair and maintenance expenses. Your
                    vehicle is equipped with a collision sensing and diagnosis module. If a collision accident reaches
                    certain strength, the module may record relevant collision information after the collision. If you
                    have any questions about the airbag working condition of your vehicle in a collision accident,
                    please contact the JSW MG authorised service center in time for professional analysis and diagnosis.

                  <p><strong>How is the airbag inﬂated? </strong>During inﬂation, the sensing system sends an electronic
                    signal that triggers the gas generator to release gas to ﬁll the airbag, causing the airbag to
                    inﬂate and eject from the cover. The gas generator, airbag and relevant members are all components
                    of the airbag module. Please refer to "Airbag Position" for details.</p>
                  <p><strong>How does the airbag provide protection? </strong>The airbags supplement the protection
                    provided by the seat belts by distributing the impact forces more evenly over the occupant's body.
                    However, in collisions where the occupant's body is not moving in the direction of the airbag, and
                    in collisions where an external object has entered the vehicle, the airbag is unable to provide the
                    appropriate protection. The airbag shall only be seen as a supplementary device to the seat belt.

                    automatically unlocking doors, turning on hazard warning lamps and turning off fuel system after
                    airbag inﬂation. The driver can use corresponding function switch to lock doors, turn off indoors

                  <p>EBD watches and manages how hard the brakes press on the back wheels to make driving safer when you

                    functions of ABS and TCS. It includes sensors like the yaw rate sensor, lateral acceleration sensor,
                    and steering wheel angle sensor. These sensors help monitor and control the driving and braking
                    forces of all wheels- front, rear, left, and right-through a computer (ECU). This ensures the
                    vehicle stays stable during turns and manoeuvres. If the driver pushes the limits, especially during
                    high-speed turns, the ESC system steps in automatically to regain control and keep the vehicle safe.
                  </p>
                  <p>Indicators relevant to the ESC system consist of ABS MIL, EBD MIL, ESC MIL and ESC OFF indicator.
                  </p>
                  <p>1) Indicators illuminate for self- inspect when the instrument is turned on. The 4 indicators are
                    normally on for 3s, indicating that the ESC system is conducting self-inspect and indicators work
                    normally. The 4 indicators go out 3s later under the normal condition.</p>

                  <p>When faults (such as neglected installation, loosened connector, abnormal CAN communication) exist
                    on the ESC system, only the ESC OFF lamp will go out 3s later, and the other 3 lamps are normally.
                  </p>
                  <p>2) In the process of driving, if the ESC function is activated, the ESC lamp will ﬂicker, telling
                    the user that the ESC system is working. If the ESC system functions are abnormal but the ABS+EBD
                    system functions are normal, the ESC lamp is normally on, indicating that the ESC system gets
                    faulted. If the ESC system and the ABS function are abnormal and the EBD system functions are
                    normal, the ESC lamp and the ABS lamp are normally on.</p>
                  <p>3) The ESC OFF lamp is used to indicate that the ESC function is disabled (the lamp will be
                    normally on so long as the ESC function is disabled; the lamp will go out if the function is
                    enabled).</p>

                  <p>If the user disables the ESC, some ESC functions will be disabled, and the ESC OFF lamp will
                    illuminate. If ESC is working when it is to be disabled, the ESC function will not be disabled
                    immediately and will be disabled after the work is over. If the user enables the ESC again, all
                    functions will be restored.</p>
                  <p>4) Each time the vehicle is started, the ESC system will be activated automatically.</p>

                    its light will blink to let you know the system is active. But if the ESC light stays on without
                    blinking, it means there is a problem with the system.</p>

                  <p><strong>Tips to get maximum range while driving EV</strong></p>
                  <p>1. If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal instead of using the brake pedal when
                    gradually slowing down. Whenever the vehicle is moving and you are not pressing the
                    accelerator pedal, regenerative braking slows down the vehicle and feeds surplus energy back
                    to the HV battery.</p>
                  <p>2. Limit the use of resources such as heating, and air conditioning. If you operate the air
                    conditioner/heater for long duration, it will use too much electricity from HV battery.Turn
                    OFF the heater and air conditioner if you do not need them.</p>
                  <p>3. Using the climate control system to heat the cabin when the outside temperature is below
                    0°C uses more electricity and affects vehicle range more than when using the heater when the
                    temperature is above 0°C.</p>
                  <p>4. Press and hold the accelerator pedal to maintain speed and drive economically.</p>
                  <p>5. Gradually press and release the accelerator pedal when accelerating or decelerating.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="section-column-col section-column-two">

                <div class="x-p-8-0">
                  <p>6. Do not use unnecessary electrical components while driving.</p>
                  <p>7. Do not load unnecessary items in the vehicle trunk. Any additional load in the car drains
                    the battery. Do not add more accessories, do not keep dead weight in the car, and in general
                    travel as light as possible.</p>
                  <p>8. Do not mount parts on the exterior of the car as it might increase drag.</p>
                  <p>9. Service schedule should be adhered to. Fluid levels should be maintained within tolerance
                    limits. Both of these also helps in realizing the maximum range potential of an electric vehicle</p>
                  <p>10. To optimize driving range use drive/eco mode and maintain the recommended tyre pressure.</p>
                  <p>11. Drive in ECO mode</p>
                  <p>12. ECO mode helps reduce power consumption by reducing acceleration when compared to the same
                    accelerator pedal position in the D (Drive) position.</p>
                  <p>13. Drive at a constant speed. Maintain cruising speeds with constant accelerator positions as much
                    as possible.</p>
                  <p>14. Accelerate slowly and smoothly. Gently press and release the accelerator pedal for acceleration
                    and deceleration.</p>
                  <p>15. Vehicle range may be substantially reduced in extremely cold conditions (for example, 0°C).</p>
                  <p>16. Release the accelerator pedal to slow down and do not apply the brakes when traffic and road
                    conditions allow.</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>If conditions permit, it is recommended that you charge the vehicle when parking it. Shallow
                      charge and discharge is conducive to prolonging the battery life. Do not wait until the battery
                      runs out before recharging, which may not be conducive to your next trip and the battery life.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the SOC low warning light goes on during driving, it indicates that the HV battery pack is
                      low and needs to be charged as soon as possible.</li>
                    <li>When the SOC indicator indicates low remaining power, or the driving range cannot meet the
                      travel demand, charging is required.</li>

                    about 1.3 meters. For some models, the door handles unfold automatically; if not, the handles need
                    to be manually pressed to open. When the key is about 2.3 meters away from the vehicle, the vehicle
                    automatically powers off, locks, retracts the door handles, and raises the windows.</p>

                  this speed range, along with following other driving tips, can signiﬁcantly increase your mileage. On
                  highways, it's recommended to maintain a speed between 60 to 80 km/h to optimize range. Higher speeds

                      <p>When driving on long, steep gradients, it is important to lessen the strain on the brakes by
                        releasing the accelerator pedal. This action utilizes regenerative braking to its advantage and
                        prevents the service brakes from overheating, which could otherwise reduce their effectiveness.

                        to be placed back in the rechargeable area. Note: The size of each brand of mobile phone is
                        different, and the position of the charging coil on the mobile phone is different. Please adjust
                        the position of the mobile phone accordingly. In addition, the case of some mobile phones may
                        have an impact on wireless charging. It may be necessary to adjust or remove the case to achieve
                        wireless charging.</p>

                  your vehicle maintained and repaired by JSW MG authorised service center. These dealers meet MG's
                  stringent service quality standards and receive technical support to ensure your satisfaction.</p>
                <p><strong>b. Owner's responsibility </strong>It is the owner's responsibility to manage maintenance
                  services and retain records. Keep documents demonstrating proper maintenance as per the scheduled
                  service charts provided in the following pages. These records are essential to validate compliance
                  with your vehicle's servicing and maintenance requirements outlined in your Service Passport, which
                  also contains detailed warranty information.</p>

                <p>Wear protective gloves and glasses since battery acid is highly corrosive!
                  The battery can not be turned over because the acid may ﬂow out of the air vent. If the acid splashes
                  into eyes, wash with clean water for a few minutes, then go to see a doctor immediately. If the acid
                  splashes on skin or clothes, immediately neutralize it with rich soap solution and rinse with plenty
                  of water. If you mistakenly drink acid, go to see a doctor immediately.</p>
                <p>Open ﬂames, electric sparks, strong light and smoking are prohibited! Avoid sparking when handling
                  cables and electrical equipment and removing electrostatic loads. Battery electrode must not be short-
                  circuited because sparks with high energy pose a risk of injury.</p>

                  the MAX mark.</p>
                <p>A low level in the brake ﬂuid reservoir can be caused by leakage in the brake system or normal wear
                  of the brake pads/linings. Please contact the JSW MG authorised service center to check whether the
                  system needs to be repaired. If repairs are necessary, add ﬂuid after repairing the hydraulic brake

                <p><strong>Lamp fogging: </strong>When the headlamp is on, a large amount of heat will be generated,
                  which needs to be dissipated through the vent hole on the lamp, so the lamp is not completely sealed,
                  and humid air can enter the lamp through the vent hole. When the temperature in the lamp is obviously
                  higher than the ambient temperature or the ambient humidity is high, for example, in cold or humid
                  weather, or when the vehicle is running in rain, or after it is washed, the water vapor inside the
                  lamp will condense on the surface of the lamp cover, resulting in water mist (similar to the fogging
                  phenomenon of the window glass). It is normal that the lighting function and the service life of
                  headlamps will not be affected. Park the vehicle in a dry, ventilated area and the moisture will
                  gradually dissipate. The water mist dissipates faster when the vehicle is driving with lamps on or
                  exposed to sunlight, but there may still be residue at the corners of the lamps.</p>
                <p>It may take 2-3 days for the water mist to completely dissipate. If there are a lot of water drops or
                  accumulated water in the lamp, please contact the JSW MG authorised service center for maintenance.

                <p><strong>General terms and conditions remain with your vehicle: </strong>Once you have called JSW MG
                  Roadside Assistance, it is vital that you stay with your vehicle. Should the JSW MG Roadside
                  Assistance representative arrive at your vehicle while it is unattended, the necessary work will not
                  be carried out.</p>
                <p><strong>Adverse Weather </strong>On occasion, adverse weather conditions such as ﬂoods, heavy rain,
                  thunder / lighting, other natural calamities or other external factors may affect our ability to
                  provide services and it may become physically impossible to assist you until the weather improves.
                  During such times, our main priority will be to ensure that you and your passengers are taken to a
                  place of safety; the recovery of your vehicle may not be possible until weather conditions permit.</p>
                <p><strong>External Factors </strong>MG will take every effort to reach you once you make the call
                  however external conditions (including traffic, strike etc.), could delay such an effort.</p>

                <p><strong>Locked Keys: </strong>Whilst we will always endeavour to provide assistance by the most
                  efficient method, modern security systems sometimes make it extremely difficult for us to gain entry
                  to your vehicle at the roadside, should the spare keys not be available. If a forced emergency entry
                  is required, you will be asked to sign a declaration stating that you have granted permission for this
                  to take place and conﬁrming that all costs relating to any resulting damages to your vehicle will be
                  your sole responsibility.</p>
                <p><strong>Replacement Costs </strong>The replacement cost for any damaged part of the vehicle shall not
                  be covered by JSW MG Roadside Assistance, unless it is covered under any other warranty(ies) provided
                  by JSW MG Motor, including the new vehicle warranty, as may be applicable and / or subscribed to by
